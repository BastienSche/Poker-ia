<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive web application for real-time Texas Hold'em Spin & Go poker analysis, progressing from initial setup to a feature-rich, optimized, and now free-to-use product. The development trajectory highlights an iterative process driven by detailed user feedback. Initially, the focus was on establishing a React frontend and FastAPI backend with OpenAI Vision for card recognition. Subsequent interactions led to significant performance optimizations, including caching and a shift to local computer vision to reduce latency and cost. Key challenges involved accurate board recognition, addressing  errors in the poker engine, and improving UI responsiveness. The engineer consistently adapted the architecture, integrating advanced poker libraries (, ) for precise equity and ICM calculations. The final pivot involved replacing OpenAI Vision with a 100% free local computer vision solution, prompted by budget exhaustion. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving, incorporating a detailed debug console and sequential analysis guide to enhance user experience and transparency.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to develop an innovative macOS web application for real-time analysis of 3-player Texas Hold'em Spin & Go poker games. The application needs to capture screen/window, perform advanced visual recognition of poker elements (blinds, bets, chips, players, cards, positions, actions), and provide ergonomic, always-on-top UI with synthetic game views. A strategic analysis engine must calculate optimal actions (fold, call, raise) based on probabilities, ICM, position, stacks, and ranges, with customizable aggressiveness. Security and privacy are paramount, ensuring data isn't transmitted and offering a no-recording option. Customization options include language, capture zone, analysis frequency, and saving game history. The application should be optimized for Apple Silicon MacBooks, using native macOS frameworks. The user later clarified a modern web approach using Web APIs for screen capture and OpenAI Vision, aiming for a complete, production-ready solution, not just an MVP. Further requirements emerged: faster and more accurate analysis, better board recognition, in-app debug logs, detailed poker statistics, sequential game phase analysis, and ultimately, a 100% free, local AI solution for instant analysis due to OpenAI budget concerns.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a major architectural shift in the backend: transitioning from an OpenAI Vision-based analysis to a 100% free, local computer vision (OpenCV) solution. This change was necessitated by the user reporting that the OpenAI budget had been exceeded. The engineer updated  to include , modified  and  to integrate local CV, and introduced a new API endpoint . Initial tests for this new free API endpoint () showed an ULTRA-RAPIDE response time of 0.001s, indicating a successful shift away from paid external AI services. The current state is that the backend is configured to use the free local CV, and the API reflects this with a 100% GRATUIT! message.
